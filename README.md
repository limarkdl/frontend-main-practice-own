# frontend-main-practice
🚀 Welcome to this expansive and highly immersive repository, which demonstrates a practical, hands-on approach to front-end development. This project is supposed to be done in 3 months and is inspired from UlbiTV FrontEnd paid course. This project, created with React, delves deep into a broad range of front-end technologies, showcasing what I've accomplished and learnt along the way. This is not only a testament to my skills but a robust toolkit for developers across various levels of expertise. 💻

The highlight here is the practical construction of a large-scale, ready-for-production application, surpassing the confines of a typical tutorial or course. You'll see the set-up of the complete project infrastructure, the configuration of the test environment, and data interaction. This learning journey culminates in an advanced, technically comprehensive project, with a detailed git commit history documenting my progression. 🛠️🔧

While React serves as the foundational technology, the repository extends well beyond. It provides an intensive exploration into the front-end development landscape, encompassing configurations, testing techniques, data normalization, error management, internationalization (i18n), TypeScript, and Babel. These assets render the repository equally useful for Vue, Svelte, and Angular developers. 🌍👏

From full-fledged project configuration involving Webpack, React, TypeScript, Babel, and more, to building a library of over 20 UI components, this repository leaves no stone unturned. It also delves into key areas of software architecture, performance optimization, and solving real-life development tasks. The repository covers CSS modules, theming, unit and E2E testing, linting, error handling, routing, Redux-based data handling, CI/CD setup, and pre-commit hooks. 🔍📚

A significant aspect of this repository is its focus on testing. You'll witness setting up a Storybook from scratch, implementation of screenshot tests, unit tests, and E2E tests. We'll also explore linting with eslint and stylelint and code formatting with Prettier. All these aspects accompany error management, data normalization, virtualization, infrastructure setup, and the refinement of the development process. 💡🔬

The repository navigates complex topics like migrating to React 18, handling ring dependencies, setting up alternative bundling with Vite, automated refactoring, and much more. Finally, it ventures into deployment, working with a cloud server, setting up Nginx, managing HTTPS and domain names. 🏁🚀

This project repository not only showcases what I've learned but also equips me with practical skills that are highly in-demand in today's market. Buckle up and join me on this exhilarating journey through the cosmos of front-end development! 🌟🔥
