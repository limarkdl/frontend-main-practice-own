Greetings! Welcome to my ambitious project for this summer break, the UCLan Merch Shop Challenge. This is a testament to my attempts at full-stack development and an attempt to create a high-quality application.

## 📝 _About the Project_
The UCLan Merch Shop project was inspired by an assignment in my Web Technology module during my second year. With this project, I aim to revisit that assignment but with more advanced skills and a keen interest in web technology.

## 🌟 _Goal and Duration_
My goal over the next three months is to build a robust, production-ready system complete with a fully configured project infrastructure and test environment. The project aims to reflect my progress and learning through a detailed git commit history.

## 💻 _Technologies Used_
The core technologies in this project include React for the front-end and PHP and MySQL for the back-end. The project will also involve a deep dive into a range of development techniques like configurations, testing techniques, data normalization, error management, internationalization (i18n), TypeScript, Babel, and more.

## 📚 _What I'll be Learning_
I'll explore project configuration with Webpack, React, TypeScript, Babel, and more. The project will touch on critical aspects of software architecture, performance optimization, CSS modules, theming, unit and E2E testing, linting, error handling, routing, Redux-based data handling, CI/CD setup, and pre-commit hooks.

## 🔬 _Emphasis on Testing_
This project places a strong emphasis on testing. I'll set up a Storybook from scratch and implement screenshot tests, unit tests, and E2E tests. Linting with eslint and stylelint, along with code formatting with Prettier, will be explored.

## 🚀 _Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)_
A standout aspect of this project is the adoption of Feature-Sliced Design (FSD), a relatively new approach in front-end architectures that structures the project based on its business domains. I aim to learn and apply FSD and evaluate its potential advantages and drawbacks.

## 🌐 _Complex Topics_
The journey will take me through complex topics like migrating to React 18, handling ring dependencies, setting up alternative bundling with Vite, automated refactoring, and more. The deployment process, including working with a cloud server, setting up Nginx, managing HTTPS, and domain names will also be part of this exploration.

## 🔥 _Conclusion_
This project is another step towards the web developing. It's a testimony to my learning, my progress, and the practical skills that I'm gaining. Good luck to me!
